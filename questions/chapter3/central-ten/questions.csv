Which of the following variables would it not be suitable to calculate the mean for?,4,Household income,Mode of transportation,Distance traveled,Age of participants,,,,option2,"Correct! Mode of transportation is a categorical variable as it represents types of transportation, for which the mean cannot be calculated.","Incorrect. Household income, distance traveled, and age of participants are all numerical variables, so calculating the mean is appropriate.",mcq
"A personal trainer records the amount of push-ups done in 1 minute for 8 of his clients. Calculate the mean: 14, 10, 8, 9, 15, 20, 7, 11.",0,,,,,,,,11.75,"Correct! The mean is calculated by summing the data points (94) and dividing by 8, resulting in a mean of 11.75 push-ups.",Incorrect. The correct calculation is: (14+10+8+9+15+20+7+11) ÷ 8 = 11.75 push-ups.,fitb
"A runner tracks the distance she runs, in kilometers, everyday for 10 days. Calculate the median: 4, 5, 8, 8, 8, 8, 9, 10, 6, 7.",0,,,,,,,,8,"Correct! After arranging the data in ascending order, the median is the average of the 5th and 6th values: (8+8)/2 = 8 km.","Incorrect. The data should be arranged: 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 8, 8, 8, 9, 10. The median is the average of the 5th and 6th values, which is 8.",fitb
"A basketball coach records the number of missed free throws over the course of 7 games. Calculate the median: 3, 4, 2, 5, 3, 7, 8.",0,,,,,,,,4,"Correct! The median of the ordered data set (2, 3, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8) is the middle value, which is 4 missed free throws.","Incorrect. The correct median is the middle value in the ordered set: 2, 3, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8. Thus, the median is 4 missed free throws.",fitb
"A soccer player ran sprints 6 times and his trainer recorded the time in minutes. Identify the mode: 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 3.",0,,,,,,,,1,"Correct! The mode is 1 minute as it appears three times in the data set, which is more frequent than the other values.","Incorrect. The correct mode is 1, as it appears more frequently (3 times) compared to the other numbers.",fitb
Why is the mode the only suitable measure of central tendency for describing the variable “type of daily transportation”?,0,,,,,,,,Nominal variable,"Correct! The type of daily transportation is a nominal variable, meaning there is no meaningful order, so you cannot calculate the mean or median. The mode reports the most frequent value.","Incorrect. The mode is the only suitable measure of central tendency for nominal variables like transportation type, because there is no meaningful order to calculate the mean or median.",fitb
In which type of distribution is the median most likely to be greater than the mean?,3,Symmetric distribution,Negatively-skewed distribution,Positively-skewed distribution,,,,,option2,"Correct! In a negatively-skewed distribution, the mean is pulled down by very low values, making the median greater than the mean.","Incorrect. The median is greater than the mean in a negatively-skewed distribution, where the tail is on the left. In a symmetric distribution, the mean and median are equal, and in a positively-skewed distribution, the mean is greater than the median.",mcq
For which of the following variables is the median not an appropriate measure of central tendency?,4,The number of sets performed,The type of exercises preferred,The rating of exercise satisfaction,The amount of weight lifted in deadlifts,,,,option3,"Correct! The rating of exercise satisfaction is a categorical variable, and the median cannot be used as it is not a numerical value. Mode would be an appropriate choice.",Incorrect. The median is inappropriate for the rating of exercise satisfaction because it is a categorical variable. The median can only be used for quantitative variables.,mcq
When is it necessary to calculate the mean in order to find the median in a distribution?,4,When the data is not skewed,When the data contains an even number of values,When the data contains an odd number of values,You always have to calculate the mean to find the median,,,,option2,"Correct! When the data contains an even number of values, there is no single middle value, so you must calculate the mean of the two middle values to find the median.","Incorrect. When the data has an odd number of values, the median is simply the middle value, so no need to calculate the mean.",mcq
Which of the following represents the mode?,4,The average number of sets completed in strength training,The total steps taken in a week,The most commonly reported type of exercise in a study,The winner of the tennis match,,,,option3,"Correct! The mode is the most frequent value. Here, the most commonly reported type of exercise represents the mode, which refers to the value that appears most often.","Incorrect. The mode refers to the most frequent value in a dataset, which in this case is the most commonly reported type of exercise. The other options describe the mean, sum, or irrelevant data.",mcq
For which of the following variables would it be appropriate to calculate the mean?,4,Heart rate during exercise,"Type of exercise (cardio, resistance training)","Intensity of exercise (light, moderate, vigorous)",All of the above,,,,option1,"Correct! Heart rate is a numerical variable, so calculating the mean is appropriate. The type and intensity of exercise are categorical, and calculating the mean would not be meaningful.","Incorrect. Only heart rate is numerical, and therefore appropriate for calculating the mean. The other variables are categorical, making the mean unsuitable.",mcq
What is the mode in a distribution?,4,Nth value,1st value,Most frequent value,Middle value,,,,option3,"Correct! The mode is the value that appears most frequently in a dataset, which can be applied to both numerical and categorical data.","Incorrect. The mode is the most frequent value in a dataset, not the 1st, middle, or Nth value unless they happen to be the most frequent.",mcq
Which level(s) of measurement is/are suitable for calculating the mode as the measure of central tendency?,5,Nominal,Interval,Nominal and ordinal,Ratio,Interval and ratio,,,option1,"Correct! Nominal data is appropriate for calculating the mode because it measures frequency, which is a characteristic of mode.","Incorrect. Only nominal level data is suitable for calculating the mode, as it is based on frequencies.",mcq
What is the midpoint of a distribution when n=20?,0,,,,,,,,10.5,"Correct! The midpoint of a dataset with 20 values is the average of the 10th and 11th values, which gives 10.5.",Incorrect. The midpoint for a dataset with 20 values is calculated by averaging the 10th and 11th positions.,fitb
"Calculate the mean of the following data set: 4, 18, 16, 14, 7, 10, 15. Round your answer to the nearest two decimal places.",0,,,,,,,,12,"Correct! The mean is calculated by summing the values (84) and dividing by the number of data points (7), giving a mean of 12.00.",Incorrect. The correct mean is 12.00. Sum the values (84) and divide by 7.,fitb
The mean value for a set of 15 values is 4.3. A new value of 5 is added to the data set. What will happen to the mean value?,4,The mean will change to 5,The mean will stay the same,The mean will increase,The mean will decrease,,,,option3,"Correct! Adding a value of 5, which is higher than the current mean of 4.3, will slightly increase the overall mean.",Incorrect. Adding a value greater than the mean will cause the mean to increase.,mcq
When is it most likely that the median is greater than the mean?,3,Positively skewed distribution,Symmetric distribution,Negatively skewed,,,,,option3,"Correct! In a negatively-skewed distribution, low outlier values pull the mean down, making the median greater than the mean.","Incorrect. In a negatively-skewed distribution, the tail is on the left, and lower values reduce the mean, making the median greater.",mcq
Exam scores in a difficult physiology course have a bimodal distribution with a peak at the A range and a peak at the C range. Which measure of central tendency would be appropriate to report and why?,4,The mode would be appropriate because both of the peaks (modes) would be reported and are useful to describe the typical responses of participants.,The mean would be appropriate because exam score is a ratio variable.,"For a distribution with more than one peak, central tendency is not a useful measure.",The median would be appropriate because it would be most helpful to know the value between the two peaks.,,,,option1,"Correct! A bimodal distribution shows two distinct peaks. Reporting the modes will clearly indicate the common score ranges, such as A’s and C’s, providing a more accurate representation of the data.","Incorrect. The mean could be misleading in a bimodal distribution, and the median might fall between peaks, not reflecting the distribution’s nature. The mode is the most suitable measure to report in this case because it accurately shows both common score ranges.",mcq
Which measure of central tendency should be reported for the variable state of exercise frequency?,4,Mean,Mode,Median,Range,,,,option2,"Correct! Since exercise frequency is a categorical and ordinal variable, the mode is the most appropriate measure of central tendency as it identifies the most frequent category or value reported.","Incorrect. The mean and median are more suitable for numerical variables, while the range is not a measure of central tendency. In this case, the mode best represents the most common exercise frequency.",mcq
