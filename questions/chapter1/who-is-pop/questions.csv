A researcher wants to survey kinesiology students about their physical activity habits. Can the results be generalized to the whole student population of U of A?,2,Yes,No,,,,,,option2,"Correct! Kinesiology students may have different physical activity habits compared to students from other faculties, so their habits may not represent the broader student population.","Incorrect. Kinesiology students may not reflect the entire U of A student population, so the results should not be generalized.",mcq
"Which situation demonstrates a sampling method that could result in a non-representative population for the Faculty of Kinesiology, Sport, and Recreation-wide study?",4,Collecting responses from students at a Panda’s soccer game,Surveying students/staff from various degrees/research areas under the faculty,Using random sampling to survey students,Including students from all years in the faculty,,,,option1,"Correct! Collecting responses only from students attending a Panda’s soccer game may lead to an unrepresentative sample because they may share characteristics unique to that setting, such as a greater interest in sports or socializing with peers.","Incorrect. Other methods like surveying across various degrees, random sampling, or including students from all years are more likely to capture a representative sample of the faculty.",mcq
58% of those polled go to the Hanson Fitness and Lifestyle Centre daily. This is an example of ______ statistic or parameter.,2,Statistic,Parameter,,,,,,option1,Correct!

Is this inferential or descriptive?,2,Inferential,Descriptive,,,,,,option2,"Correct! The statement is describing data collected from a sample, and is not used to make inferences about the population.",Incorrect.

The statement “77% of the class play basketball and 23% play soccer” is an example of a(n) ____ inferential or descriptive statistic.,2,Inferential,Descriptive,,,,,,option2,"Correct! Descriptive statistics summarize or describe characteristics of a dataset. Here, 77% and 23% summarize the students that play basketball or soccer.","Incorrect. Inferential statistics would involve making predictions or inferences about a larger population, which is not the case here.",mcq
A population ______ is estimated by a sample _____ .,3,Qualitative observation,Parameter; data set,Parameter; statistic,,,,,option3,"Correct! A population parameter describes the entire population, while a sample statistic is an estimate derived from the sample data to represent the parameter.","Incorrect. The correct pairing is ""Parameter; statistic,"" where the parameter refers to the population characteristic and the statistic refers to the sample-based estimate.",mcq
"Hanson Fitness and Lifestyle Centre has 25 000 users, this is an example of ____ statistic or parameter.",2,Statistic,Parameter,,,,,,option2,"Correct! A parameter refers to a value that describes a characteristic of an entire population. In this case, 25 000 users represent the entire population of Hanson Fitness and Lifestyle Centre.","Incorrect. A parameter describes a whole population, whereas a statistic refers to a sample. This question involves the entire population of users.",mcq
What kind of error occurs when the sample is not representative of the population?,4,Sampling error,Type 1 error,Type 2 error,Confounding error,,,,option1,"Correct! A sampling error occurs when a sample does not accurately reflect the characteristics of the population, leading to potential bias or inaccuracies.","Incorrect. The correct answer is sampling error, which occurs when a sample is not representative of the population.",mcq
______ is obtained from a population.,0,,,,,,,,parameter,Correct! A parameter is a value that describes a characteristic of an entire population.,"Incorrect. A statistic is obtained from a sample, not from a population.",fitb
What does a sample typically include?,4,all members of a population,any subset of population,one member of a population,half of a population,,,,option2,"Correct!

A sample of all students enrolled in the Faculty of Kinesiology is a _____ representative or biased sample.,2,Representative,Biased,,,,,,option2,Correct! A sample of students in the Faculty of Kinesiology may not represent the height distribution of all students at the university.,"Incorrect. This is a biased sample, as it does not account for the entire population.",mcq
A sample of students from each faculty at the University of Alberta is a _____ representative or biased sample.,2,Representative,Biased,,,,,,option1,Correct!
