Choose if this is a discrete or continuous variable: Height,2,Discrete,Continuous,,,,,,option2,Correct! Height is a continuous variable because it can be measured with precision.,Incorrect. Height is a continuous variable because it can take any value in a range.,mcq
Choose if this is a discrete or continuous variable: Species,2,Discrete,Continuous,,,,,,option1,Correct! Species is discrete because it involves categories that can be counted.,Incorrect. Species is a discrete variable as it involves distinct categories.,mcq
Choose if this is a discrete or continuous variable: Dog breeds,2,Discrete,Continuous,,,,,,option1,Correct! Dog breeds are discrete as they represent categories that can be counted.,Incorrect. Dog breeds are discrete variables because they are distinct categories.,mcq
A professor investigated whether a 10-minute break or no break during class influenced studentsâ€™ learning performance. What is varied by the professor?,4,Professor presence,10 minute break,Learning performance of student,Class attendance,,,,option2,Correct! The professor is manipulating the 10-minute break to see its effect on learning performance.,"Incorrect. The 10-minute break is the variable the professor is manipulating, not the other options.",mcq
Reaction time in seconds is a discrete or continuous variable?,2,Discrete,Continuous,,,,,,option2,"Correct! Reaction time is a continuous variable because it can be measured with increasing precision, including fractions of a second.",Incorrect. Reaction time is a continuous variable because it can take any value within a range and is not restricted to whole numbers.,mcq
Which of these variables is continuous?,4,Driving age,High school grade level,Skin temperature,Heart rate,,,,option3,Correct! Skin temperature is continuous because it can take on any value within a range and can be measured with increasing precision.,"Incorrect. Skin temperature is continuous, while driving age, high school grade level, and heart rate are generally considered discrete variables.",mcq
Which of these variables is discrete?,4,Completion time,Weight,Drinking age,Height,,,,option3,"Correct! Drinking age is discrete because it is typically measured in whole years, representing distinct values.","Incorrect. Drinking age is a discrete variable, while completion time, weight, and height are generally continuous variables.",mcq
Which of these variables is categorical?,4,Blood type,Age in years,Jean size,iPad storage size,,,,option1,"Correct! Blood type is a categorical variable, as it represents categories with no inherent numerical order.","Incorrect. Blood type is a categorical variable, while the other options have a numerical or ordinal aspect.",mcq
A coach measures the proportion of male to female athletes in the soccer program at a high school. What type of variable is the proportion of male to female athletes?,4,Continuous,Qualitative,Discrete,Categorical,,,,option1,Correct! Proportions are continuous variables as they can take any value within a range and be measured with increasing precision.,"Incorrect. The proportion is a continuous variable, not qualitative, categorical, or discrete, as it represents a ratio that can have many possible values.",mcq
