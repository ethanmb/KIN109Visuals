One way to measure team pride of players would be to count the number of times players wear team gear outside of practice and game days in a season. The number of times a player wears team gear would be considered at which level of measurement?,4,Nominal,Interval,Ratio,Ordinal,,,,option3,Correct! This is a ratio level of measurement because it includes a true zero point (not wearing team gear) and is numerical.,Incorrect. The number of times is a ratio level measurement because it includes a true zero and allows for meaningful comparisons.,mcq
Martin investigated the reflexes of Formula One drivers by measuring their reaction times to the green light in the race car. What was the scale of measurement for the variable reaction time measured in seconds?,4,Nominal,Interval,Ratio,Ordinal,,,,option3,Correct! Reaction time in seconds is a ratio scale because it has a true zero point and can be used to calculate ratios.,Incorrect. Reaction time is measured on a ratio scale due to the true zero and the ability to calculate meaningful ratios.,mcq
Which scale of measurement do researchers generally use to categorize summed questionnaire or survey scores?,4,Nominal scale,Ordinal scale,Interval scale,Ratio scale,,,,option2,"Correct! Researchers generally use the ordinal scale for questionnaire scores because the values can be ranked, though intervals may not be equal.","Incorrect. Summed scores are typically categorized using the ordinal scale, where the order is meaningful but intervals may vary.",mcq
What scale(s) of measurement quantify the variable being measured?,5,Nominal scale,Ordinal scale,Interval scale,Ratio scale,C and D,,,option5,"Correct! Interval and ratio scales are numerical and can be quantified, making them suitable for measurement.",Incorrect. Only the interval and ratio scales allow for quantification of the variable being measured.,mcq
"In KIN 435 (Applied Resistance Training), the professor recorded the weight his students could lift in a deadlift. What is the scale of measurement for the variable “weight lifted”?",5,Ratio,Interval,Nominal,Ordinal,None of the above,,,option1,Correct! The weight lifted is measured on a ratio scale because it has a true zero and equal intervals.,"Incorrect. The correct answer is Ratio. The weight lifted has a true zero and equal intervals, which is characteristic of a ratio scale. It is not ordinal or nominal.",mcq
"In a yoga class, participants were asked to rank their discomfort levels on a scale of 1 to 5, with 1 being least discomfort and 5 being most discomfort, after performing a stretch. What is the scale of measurement for the variable ""discomfort level""?",4,Interval,Ratio,Ordinal,Nominal,,,,option3,"Correct! The ranking of discomfort indicates an order, but the intervals between ranks are not necessarily equal, making it an ordinal scale.","Incorrect. The correct answer is Ordinal. The ranking system does not have equal intervals, which is why it is not an interval or ratio scale.",mcq
"A researcher categorizes participants into different groups based on their favourite form of physical activity: running, swimming, cycling, resistance training, or pilates. What is the scale of measurement for the variable ""form of physical activity""?",4,Ratio,Nominal,Interval,Ordinal,,,,option2,"Correct! The variable involves categorizing without inherent order, making it nominal.","Incorrect. The correct answer is Nominal. The variable represents categories with no specific order or ranking, not an interval or ratio scale.",mcq
What is the scale of measurement for the variable “body weight”?,4,Interval,Nominal,Ratio,Ordinal,,,,option3,Correct! Body weight is measured on a ratio scale because it has a true zero point (0kg would indicate no weight lost during the race) and the intervals between the values are equal.,Incorrect. The correct answer is Ratio.,mcq
