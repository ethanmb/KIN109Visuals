Researchers assigned participants to one of three exercise programs and then measured the mean improvement in cardiovascular fitness for each group. Is a correlational analysis appropriate for this scenario?,4,"Yes, because two variables are being compared.","No, there are only two variables.","Yes, because they are analyzing the difference between groups.","No, because one of the variables is categorical.",,,,option4,Correct! Correlation analysis is not appropriate because one of the variables is categorical (exercise programs).,"Incorrect. Correlation requires two continuous variables, not a mix of continuous and categorical.",mcq
"If r = .96, then the relationship between the variables of interest is",4,Statistically significant.,Important and statistically significant.,Nearly as strong as mathematically possible.,Important.,,,,option3,"Correct! An r-value of 0.96 indicates a very strong relationship, as it is close to 1, nearly as strong as possible.","Incorrect. The value of r = .96 indicates strength, but it does not directly indicate statistical significance.",mcq
The Pearson correlation coefficient provides information about the _____ of a relationship.,5,Strength,Direction and strength,Direction,Statistical significance and direction,Statistical significance,,,option2,Correct! The Pearson correlation coefficient indicates both the strength and direction of a relationship.,"Incorrect. Correlation shows both strength and direction, not statistical significance or just one aspect.",mcq
Which value of r represents the strongest relationship between two variables?,4,0.75,0.02,-0.81,-0.42,,,,option3,"Correct! The strongest relationship is -0.81, as the strength is determined by the magnitude, not the sign.","Incorrect. Strength is based on the magnitude of the value, not whether it is positive or negative.",mcq
"In everyday language, the term correlation means about the same thing as relationship or association. In statistics, the more technical meaning of the word refers to",4,The standardized difference between two variables.,The percentage of variability shared between two variables.,A measure of the direction and strength of a relationship between two variables.,The ratio of two variances.,,,,option3,Correct! Correlation measures both the direction and strength of a relationship between variables.,"Incorrect. Correlation is not about shared variability, standard differences, or ratios but about direction and strength.",mcq
The smallest possible value for r² is,4,1,-1,-2,0,,,,option4,"Correct! The smallest value for r² is 0, representing no variance explained by the predictor variable.",Incorrect. r² values range from 0 to 1 because it is a squared value and cannot be negative.,mcq
"If r = −0.10, select the correct value for the coefficient of determination (in decimal form, not as a percentage).",4,0.01,0.2,0.1,10,,,,option1,Correct! The coefficient of determination (r²) is calculated by squaring the correlation coefficient (-0.10)² = 0.01.,"Incorrect. r² is obtained by squaring r, so (-0.10)² = 0.01, not 0.10 or any other value.",mcq
Effect size is used to determine,4,If a correlation is large.,"If an effect is meaningful, or important.",If an effect is statistically significant.,The slope of a regression equation.,,,,option2,"Correct! Effect size evaluates the strength and magnitude of an effect, determining its practical significance.","Incorrect. Effect size focuses on the magnitude of the effect, not statistical significance or correlation size.",mcq
Jan and colleagues (2017) analyzed the regression of self-esteem (y) on time spent on Facebook (x) and found r² = .871. Select the appropriate interpretation of this value.,4,87.1% of the variance in time on Facebook can be explained by factors other than self-esteem.,The relationship between self-esteem and social media is causal.,Social media use is a statistically significant predictor of self-esteem.,87.1% of the variance in self-esteem can be explained by time on Facebook.,,,,option4,Correct! r² = .871 means 87.1% of the variance in self-esteem (y) is explained by time spent on Facebook (x).,"Incorrect. r² refers to the variance explained in y (self-esteem), not factors unrelated to x (time on Facebook).",mcq
"In a dataset with two variables, x and y, the larger the absolute value of the product of the z-scores (zx * zy), the _________.",4,Closer the data point will be to the center of the scatterplot of x and y.,Closer the data point will be to the horizontal axis.,Farther the data point will be from the center of the scatterplot of x and y.,Farther the data point will be from the horizontal axis.,,,,option3,Correct! A larger absolute value of zx * zy indicates that the data point is farther from the center (mean) of the scatterplot.,"Incorrect. A large zx * zy moves the data point farther away from the scatterplot's center, not closer to the center or axis.",mcq
A r² value close to 1 indicates,4,That there is a causal relationship between x and y.,That little of the variation in x can be explained by y.,That much of the variation in y can be explained by x.,Statistical significance.,,,,option3,Correct! An r² value near 1 shows that most of the variance in y is explained by x.,"Incorrect. r² close to 1 represents a strong explained variance, not causation or low variation explanation.",mcq
