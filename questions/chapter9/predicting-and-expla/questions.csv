What is missing from the following results of a bivariate linear regression?,4,Effect size,P-value,F-statistic,Degrees of freedom,,,,option3,"Correct! The numerical value of the F-statistic (e.g., 123.45) is missing from the results.","Incorrect. The results show p-value, r², and degrees of freedom, but the F-statistic value is not included.",mcq
"Drs. Lopez and Carter are collaborators on a study investigating weekly hours of aerobic training and improvements in memory among students. They conducted a bivariate regression analysis with a sample size of 501, resulting in a regression mean square of 5.500 and a residual mean square of 1.445. What is the F-statistic for this regression and is it statistically significant?",4,3.81,"721.00, yes",0.05,"5.50, no",,,,option2,"Correct! The F-statistic is calculated as 5.5/1.445 ≈ 3.81, and based on the F-value, it is statistically significant, indicating a meaningful relationship.","Incorrect. The F-statistic is calculated using the regression and residual mean squares (5.5/1.445), and it is significant.",mcq
A bivariate linear regression was conducted with a sample size of 30 where height was regressed on weight. What is the degrees of freedom value of the numerator of the F-ratio for this analysis?,4,28,1,2,30,,,,option2,"Correct! The numerator degrees of freedom is equal to the number of predictors in the model. Since there is only one predictor (weight), the value is 1.",Incorrect. The degrees of freedom for the numerator corresponds to the number of predictors in the model (1).,mcq
