"Dr. Robles has conducted a regression analysis, but to test their assumptions, the outcome variable is plotted on the x-axis against the outcome residuals on the y-axis. Upon viewing the resulting scatterplot, they observe that the plot is linear but has a steep slope. What statistical assumption has most likely been violated?",4,Normality of errors,Linearity,Homoscedasticity,Independence of errors,,,,option3,Correct! Homoscedasticity assumes equal variance of residuals across predicted values. A steep slope indicates that residual variance is not constant.,Incorrect. The assumption of homoscedasticity is the most likely to be violated with a steep slope in the residual plot.,mcq
Which of the following includes all the statistics that should be reported for a correlational analysis?,4,"M, SD, F, rÂ², p","M, SD, n, r, p","M, SD, r, p","df, F, r, p",,,,option2,"Correct! For correlational analysis, the mean (M), standard deviation (SD), sample size (n), correlation coefficient (r), and p-value should be reported.","Incorrect. The correct statistics are mean, standard deviation, sample size, correlation, and p-value.",mcq
"From 2000 to 2020, a study found a correlation of r = -0.80 between the average weekly hours spent on sedentary behavior and average back squat strength (in kg) among high school athletes. This suggests that as sedentary behavior hours increased, back squat strength decreased. What else should be reported for this correlational analysis?",4,"The result of hypothesis testing, including p value",The F-statistic,The df for each variable,The standard error of the estimate,,,,option1,Correct! The p-value from hypothesis testing should be reported to indicate if the observed correlation is statistically significant.,"Incorrect. The F-statistic and df are not essential for a correlational analysis, and the standard error is not directly related.",mcq
