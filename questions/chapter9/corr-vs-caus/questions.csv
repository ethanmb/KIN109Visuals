Imagine researchers find a positive correlation between regular exercise and improved mental health among adults. Can we conclude that exercising causes improvements in mental health?,4,"No, because the exact r value (correlation coefficient) is not provided.","Yes, because the correlation is positive.","No, because another factor could be influencing both exercise habits and mental health.","Yes, because itâ€™s more likely that exercising leads to better mental health than the reverse.",,,,option3,"Correct! Correlation does not imply causation, and there could be other variables influencing both exercise and mental health.","Incorrect. While the correlation is positive, it does not establish causation due to potential confounding variables.",mcq
"If there is a confound present in the correlational relationship between the number of practices attended and improvements in game performance, then:",4,The correlation is weak or nonexistent.,The correlation is weak or nonexistent and cannot be statistically significant.,At least one additional variable is involved in the relationship.,The correlation cannot be statistically significant.,,,,option3,Correct! A confound is an extraneous variable that influences both the independent and dependent variables. It suggests at least one other variable is affecting the relationship.,"Incorrect. The presence of a confound indicates an additional variable is involved, not necessarily that the correlation is weak or insignificant.",mcq
