A researcher wants to determine whether or not a new strength training program increases muscle mass in a sample of athletes. What is the null hypothesis?,4,The strength training program has no effect on muscle mass.,The strength training program decreases muscle mass.,The strength training program increases muscle mass.,The strength training program increases muscular fitness.,,,,option1,Correct! The null hypothesis always assumes no effect or difference.,"Incorrect. The correct answer is ""The strength training program has no effect on muscle mass.""",mcq
"A group of football athletes were tested for reaction time before and after a new agility training program. The probability of obtaining the observed difference in reaction time, assuming the null hypothesis is true, is calculated to be 0.03. Which of the following is correct, assuming ùõº=0.05?",4,Reject the null hypothesis ‚Äì the program probably had an effect on reaction time.,Fail to reject the null hypothesis ‚Äì the program likely had no effect on reaction time.,Reject the alternative hypothesis ‚Äì the program did not affect reaction time.,The results are inconclusive as the p-value is greater than ùõº.,,,,option1,"Correct! The p-value of 0.03 is less than alpha (ùõº=0.05), so we reject the null hypothesis.","Incorrect. The correct answer is ""Reject the null hypothesis ‚Äì the program probably had an effect on reaction time.""",mcq
A personal trainer wants to determine whether high-intensity interval training (HITT) leads to more fat loss compared to moderate-intensity continuous training (MICT). What is the trainer‚Äôs alternative hypothesis?,4,HITT and MICT result in equal fat loss.,HITT results in less fat loss than MICT.,HITT results in more fat loss than MICT.,HITT and MICT don‚Äôt result in any fat loss.,,,,option3,Correct! The alternative hypothesis predicts that HITT results in more fat loss than MICT.,"Incorrect. The correct answer is ""HITT results in more fat loss than MICT.""",mcq
"A professor in the Faculty of Kinesiology, Sport, and Recreation conducts a study to determine whether or not a new balance training program reduces the risk of falls in elderly adults. After conducting the study, the p-value is found to be 0.08. With ùõº set at 0.05, what should be the professor‚Äôs conclusion?",4,Reject the null hypothesis ‚Äì the training program reduces the risk of falling.,Fail to reject the null hypothesis ‚Äì the evidence is insufficient to conclude that the program reduces the risk of falls.,Accept the alternative hypothesis ‚Äì the program significantly reduces risk of falls.,The result is significant.,,,,option2,"Correct! Since the p-value is greater than alpha (0.05), we fail to reject the null hypothesis.","Incorrect. The correct answer is ""Fail to reject the null hypothesis ‚Äì the evidence is insufficient to conclude that the program reduces the risk of falls.""",mcq
A shoe company wants to test the effectiveness of a new type of shoe in reducing running injuries. What would be the directional alternative hypothesis?,4,The new shoe reduces running injuries.,The new shoe has no effect on running injuries.,The new shoe increases running injuries.,The new shoe increases running speed.,,,,option1,Correct! A directional alternative hypothesis predicts that the new shoe reduces running injuries.,"Incorrect. The correct answer is ""The new shoe reduces running injuries.""",mcq
A study investigating exercise interventions yields a p-value of 0.01. What does this mean?,4,There is a 1% probability that the null hypothesis is true.,"There is a 1% probability that the observed results are due to chance, assuming the null hypothesis is true.",There is a 99% chance that the exercise intervention worked.,The probability of making a Type 1 error is 1%.,,,,option2,Correct! A p-value of 0.01 means there is a 1% chance that the observed results are due to random chance.,"Incorrect. The correct answer is ""There is a 1% probability that the observed results are due to chance, assuming the null hypothesis is true.""",mcq
