"As the ______ increases, the sampling distribution of the means becomes more and more normally distributed.",4,Population standard deviation,Population mean,Sample size,Sample variability,,,,option3,"Correct! As the sample size increases, the sampling distribution of means becomes more normal, a key part of the Central Limit Theorem.",Incorrect. The sample size is the factor that influences the normality of the sampling distribution of means.,mcq
Sampling distributions are useful in statistics because they:,4,Allow us to use a computer to simulate the data,Can be used to standardize the values in a population,Can be used to estimate the probability distribution for sampling errors.,"Allow us to collect less data than ordinarily required, by a factor of ‚àön.",,,,option3,Correct! Sampling distributions help estimate the probability distribution for sampling errors.,Incorrect. Sampling distributions are used to estimate the variability or error from sampling rather than to standardize or simulate data.,mcq
The central limit theorem makes what possible for applications of statistics?,4,it provides the formula for the area under a normal distribution.,It allows researchers to test ideas from variables with any type of distribution.,It determines the number of participants to sample for a study.,It tells researchers the optimum number of samples to create a normal distribution.,,,,option2,Correct! The central limit theorem allows testing even with non-normally distributed data if the sample size is large enough.,Incorrect. The central limit theorem is not directly related to calculating the area under a curve or determining the number of samples for a study.,mcq
The distribution of exam scores in a population is normal with a mean of 81 points and a standard deviation of 2.2.,4,When n = 30 or more,When n = 100 or more,The sampling distribution will always approximate the shape of the normal distribution.,The sampling distribution will never approximate the shape of the normal distribution.,,,,option3,"Correct! For a normal population distribution, the sampling distribution of means will always be normal regardless of sample size.",Incorrect. The shape of the population distribution ensures the sampling distribution of means will also be normal.,mcq
"As long as n > 1, which of the following best describes the relation between the standard deviation of the distribution of scores and the standard deviation of the sampling distribution of means?",4,The variance for the distribution of scores will be smaller.,The variance for the sampling distribution of means will be smaller.,The variances of the two distributions will be equal.,"Impossible to know. For some samples, one will be larger. For other samples, the other will be larger.",,,,option2,Correct! The variance for the sampling distribution of means will be smaller as sample size increases.,"Incorrect. The standard error decreases as sample size increases, making the sampling distribution less variable than the population distribution.",mcq
The formula for standard error involves dividing the standard deviation of the population by:,4,The sample size,The sample mean,The variance,The square root of the sample size,,,,option4,Correct! The formula for standard error is population standard deviation divided by the square root of the sample size.,"Incorrect. The standard error is calculated by dividing the population standard deviation by the square root of the sample size, not the variance or sample mean.",mcq
Which of the following principles explains why larger samples tend to have smaller sampling error?,4,Central Limit Theorem,Random Sampling,Law of Large Numbers,Sampling Bias,,,,option3,"Correct! The law of large numbers states that larger samples better represent the population, thus reducing sampling error.",Incorrect. The law of large numbers is the principle explaining why larger samples yield more accurate results.,mcq
Which is true of the standard error of the mean?,4,It is a statistic for a distribution made up of observations.,It decreases as ùúéX increases.,It increases as n increases.,It is a parameter of a distribution made up of statistics.,,,,option4,Correct! The standard error of the mean measures the variability in a sampling distribution of statistics.,Incorrect. The standard error is a parameter that indicates how much the sample mean deviates from the population mean.,mcq
You have collected a sample with n=18 and calculated that the standard deviation of the sample is 8.78. Calculate the estimate for the standard error of the mean.,0,,,,,,,,2.07,Correct! Plugging the values into the standard error formula results in an estimate of 2.07.,Incorrect. Use the standard error formula: divide the sample standard deviation by the square root of the sample size to get the correct answer.,fitb
"You have conducted a study with n = 10 and now plan a follow-up study. In the follow-up, you have decided that you would like to cut the standard error of the mean in half. What should your n be for the second study?",4,20,5,100,40,,,,option4,"Correct! To cut the standard error in half, the sample size must increase by a factor of 4, so n=40.","Incorrect. The sample size must be increased by a factor of 4 to reduce the standard error by half, so the correct answer is 40.",mcq
Sampling error is:,6,Both introduced by sampling without replacement and entirely avoidable if samples are correctly designed.,The difference between a sample statistic and the population parameter.,Entirely avoidable if samples are correctly designed.,Introduced by sampling without replacement.,Usually unknown.,Both the difference between a sample statistic and the population parameter and usually unknown.,,option6,"Correct! Sampling error is the difference between a sample statistic and the population parameter, and it is usually unknown due to the unknown nature of the true population parameter.",Incorrect. Sampling error is not entirely avoidable or only introduced by sampling without replacement; it relates to differences between sample and population statistics.,mcq
Which of the following are part of the central limit theorem?,4,"For sampling distributions to resemble the normal distribution, sample size should always be at n = 30 or higher.",The variability of the sampling distribution of means will always be larger than that of the population of scores.,The mean of the sampling distribution of means is smaller than the mean of the population of scores.,"For a skewed population, as sample size increases, the sampling distribution will more closely approximate a normal distribution.",,,,option4,"Correct! According to the central limit theorem, even for skewed populations, as sample size increases, the sampling distribution approaches a normal distribution.","Incorrect. While sample size impacts the normality of the distribution, the central limit theorem applies more broadly, regardless of population skewness.",mcq
