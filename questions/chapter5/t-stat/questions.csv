Which of the curves would have the least variability?,4,A t-distribution for n = 15,Variability is equal for all of these.,A z-distribution,A t-distribution for n = 3,,,,option3,Correct! A z-distribution has less variability because it is based on a known population with a fixed variance.,"Incorrect. A t-distribution has more variability, especially with smaller sample sizes, compared to a z-distribution.",mcq
"A researcher wants to compare the average scores on a physiology exam for a sample of 15 students in the fall term to the historical average score on the physiology exam of previous students. Because the exam is a standardized test, the mean and standard deviation are known. Is a one-sample t-test the best statistical test for this analysis?",4,"No, because the population standard deviation is known.","No, because the sample size is not over 30.","Yes, because the sample size is small.","Yes, because both the population mean and standard deviation are known.",,,,option1,"Correct! A one-sample t-test is not necessary because the population standard deviation is known, so a z-test is appropriate.","Incorrect. The population standard deviation is known, so a z-test should be used, not a t-test.",mcq
How does a t-distribution for n = 2 look different from the z-distribution?,4,The t-distribution would have more values in the tails of the distribution.,The t-distribution would have more values in the middle of the distribution.,The t-distribution would not be symmetric.,The two distributions would not look different.,,,,option1,Correct! A t-distribution with a small sample size (n = 2) has more values in the tails compared to a z-distribution.,Incorrect. A t-distribution for small n is characterized by heavier tails than a z-distribution.,mcq
When does a t-distribution resemble a z-distribution?,4,When there is a large population standard deviation,t-distributions never resemble a z-distribution,When sample size is small,When sample size is very large,,,,option4,"Correct! A t-distribution approaches a z-distribution as sample size increases, due to the reduced influence of variability.",Incorrect. A t-distribution with a large sample size resembles a z-distribution.,mcq
Select the statement that is true regarding when to use a one-sample t-test.,4,"A one-sample t-test is appropriate when the population mean is known, but the population standard deviation is unknown.",A one-sample t-test is appropriate when both the sample mean and the sample standard deviation are unknown.,A one-sample t-test is appropriate when both the population mean and the population standard deviation are unknown.,A one-sample t-test is appropriate when the sample standard deviation is unknown.,,,,option1,"Correct! A one-sample t-test is used when the population mean is known, but the standard deviation is unknown.",Incorrect. The one-sample t-test is used when the population mean is known but the standard deviation is unknown.,mcq
"In a study examining the effect of a new exercise program on core body temperature, researchers compared the core body temperature of an experimental group that participated in the new exercise program to a control group. The researchers measured the experimental group after 30 minutes of exercise and found the mean temperature was 99.9°F (n = 24). For a one-tailed t-test conducted to determine whether the experimental group’s mean temperature significantly exceeded the baseline of 98.5°F, with α = .05, the t-statistic was 1.85. Was the difference statistically significant?",4,"No, because the associated p-level of the t-statistic was > .05.","Yes, because the t-statistic was located in the rejection region.","No, because the t-statistic was not located in the rejection region.","Yes, because the t-statistic was close to 0.",,,,option2,"Correct! The t-statistic of 1.85 exceeds the critical value for a one-tailed test with α = .05, so it is in the rejection region.","Incorrect. The t-statistic is located in the rejection region, making the result statistically significant.",mcq
"A kinesiologist is studying whether a new physical therapy program affects the average maximum push-ups a participant can do. The established baseline for the maximum number of push-ups is 20. The researcher collects data from a sample of 30 participants who completed the program, finding an average of 22 push-ups with a standard deviation of 5.4. To determine if this average number of push-ups significantly differs from the baseline, calculate the one-sample t-statistic. Round your answer to the nearest two decimal places.",0,,,,,,,,2.03,"Correct! The calculated t-statistic is 2.03, showing a significant difference from the baseline average of 20 push-ups. Use t-statistic formula to calculate ","Incorrect. The correct t-statistic is 2.03, calculated using the given data for the sample and baseline.",fitb
"An instructor compared the average weekly minutes spent reading an online textbook for a group of students in her online class (Condition 1) to the recommended weekly minutes of reading (Condition 2). If the instructor wants to see if her online students are reading significantly less than the recommended times, then the appropriate one-tailed null hypothesis is:",5,μ1 > μ2,μ1 ≥ μ2,μ1 ≤ μ2,μ1 ≄ μ2,μ1 < μ2,,,option2,Correct! The null hypothesis assumes that students read at least as much (μ1 ≥ μ2) as the recommended times.,Incorrect. The null hypothesis for a one-tailed test should assume no difference or a greater value (μ1 ≥ μ2).,mcq
"When the population standard deviation is known, the ____ is the appropriate test; when the population standard deviation is not known, the ____ is the appropriate test.",4,t-test; z-test,σ-test; t-test,t-test; σ-test,z-test; t-test,,,,option4,"Correct! A z-test is used when the population standard deviation is known, and a t-test is used when it is not known.","Incorrect. When the population standard deviation is not known, a t-test is appropriate, not a z-test.",mcq
"After conducting a two-tailed one-sample t-test with α = .05, the researcher summarized the results as t(28) = 1.43, p > .05. Which of the following is a correct interpretation of these results?",4,"The difference was 1.43 standard deviations, which is a large difference.",The difference is statistically significant because 1.43 is in the rejection region.,There were 28 participants in the study and the difference was statistically significant.,There were 29 participants in the study and the difference was not statistically significant.,,,,option4,"Correct! The results show there were 29 participants, and the difference was not significant since p > .05.",Incorrect. The results show that the difference was not statistically significant and that there were 29 participants.,mcq
