"A researcher collects a sample of 50 participants to assess the effect of a new exercise program on muscle strength. If the standard deviation of the population is 12, what is the standard error of the mean?",0,,,,,,,,1.7,Correct! The standard error is calculated as population SD / √sample size = 12 / √50 ≈ 1.70.,Incorrect. Be sure to use the formula for standard error: population SD / √sample size.,fitb
The theoretical reaction time in an experiment is μ = 200 milliseconds with σ = 19. A sample of n = 15 people were tested while distracted with text messages and had a mean reaction time of 206.7. Calculate the z-statistic for this sample. Enter your answer rounded to the nearest two decimal places.,0,,,,,,,,1.37,Correct! The z-statistic is calculated as (206.7 - 200) / (19 / √15) ≈ 1.37.,Incorrect. Be sure to use the z-statistic formula and remember to divide the standard deviation by the square root of n.,fitb
"For a sample size of 40, a researcher studying reaction time in Formula One drivers after a new training method finds a sample mean of 200 ms. The population mean is known to be 210 ms with a standard deviation of 15 ms. What is the z-score for this sample mean?",0,,,,,,,,4.22,Correct! The z-score is calculated as (200 - 210) / (15 / √40) ≈ -4.22.,Incorrect. Be sure to use the z-score formula: z = (sample mean - population mean) / (population SD / √sample size).,fitb
An athletic therapist calculates the standard deviation of a sample mean based on a sample size of 30 and a population standard deviation of 8. What is the standard error?,0,,,,,,,,1.46,Correct! The standard error is calculated as population SD / √sample size = 8 / √30 ≈ 1.46.,Incorrect. Be sure to use the formula for standard error: population SD / √sample size.,fitb
