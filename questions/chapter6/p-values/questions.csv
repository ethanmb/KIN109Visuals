"Researchers found a statistically significant difference between mean anxiety symptoms in December 2019 and December 2020, with p = .02. Which of the following is an appropriate conclusion?",4,The likelihood of making a Type I error is p = .02.,"If the null is false, then the likelihood of finding a mean this extreme would be less than .02.","If the null is true, then the likelihood of observing a sample mean at least this extreme is less than .02.",The difference in mean anxiety symptoms in December 2020 compared to December 2019 is meaningful.,,,,option3,"Correct! If the null hypothesis is true, p indicates the probability of observing an extreme outcome.","Incorrect. This is about the likelihood of observing a sample mean this extreme, assuming the null is true.",mcq
A p-value allows us to,4,decide if data are statistically significant.,decide if data are meaningful.,reach conclusions that are independent of sample size.,prove the alternative hypothesis.,,,,option1,Correct! The p-value indicates the likelihood of observing data under the assumption of the null hypothesis.,Incorrect. A p-value assesses statistical significance but does not establish data as inherently meaningful.,mcq
Which of the following is true?,4,A result of p = .048 is more important than a result of p = .052.,"When n changes, p-values do not change.","The same difference between a sample mean and a population mean can yield different p-values, depending on n.",A value of p < .05 indicates you should fail to reject the null hypothesis.,,,,option3,"Correct! The p-value is influenced by sample size, with larger samples yielding more reliable results.","Incorrect. Sample size affects p-values, as larger samples can yield smaller p-values even for the same effect size.",mcq
"A researcher found a statistically significant difference between mean minutes for a 5km run in the morning vs. afternoon, with p = .04. Can the researcher conclude this difference is important?",4,"No, because the p-value is close to .05.","No, because the p-value does not determine importance.","Yes, because statistical significance determines importance.","Yes, because the p-value provides the same information as effect size.",,,,option2,Correct! Statistical significance does not automatically equate to practical importance.,Incorrect. P-value alone does not indicate the practical significance of a result.,mcq
Which of the following is not a misconception about p-values?,4,p is not the probability that the null hypothesis is true.,p is not the likelihood of a Type 1 error.,p is a dichotomous measure.,p is not the same as importance.,,,,option3,Correct! The p-value provides a continuous measure rather than a binary decision about the null hypothesis.,"Incorrect. P-value is not a dichotomous measure; it indicates evidence against the null, not a simple true/false value.",mcq
