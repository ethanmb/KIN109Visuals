A Type II error means a difference exists that wasn't detected.,"Incorrect. With a Type II error, a real difference is missed.",mcq
The probability of failing to reject the null hypothesis when it is actually false is equal to,4,1 - β,1 - α,beta (β),alpha (α),,,,option3,Correct! This probability is denoted as beta (β).,Incorrect. This error probability is denoted by beta (β).,mcq
"Based on findings, a coach concludes that athletes who do a specialized warm-up reduce injury risk. This conclusion could actually be a(n) ______error",4,Type II,Statistically significant,Type I,Impractical,,,,option3,"Correct! This is a Type I error, mistakenly rejecting the null hypothesis.",Incorrect. Concluding a false effect occurs is a Type I error.,mcq
The probability of making a Type I error is,4,denoted as β,typically set at .05,only applicable if null is not rejected,higher with two-tailed tests,,,,option2,Correct! Researchers often set the Type I error rate to .05.,Incorrect. The probability of a Type I error is often .05.,mcq
Select the example of a harmful outcome of a Type II error.,4,Pharmaceutical companies overcharge,Health supplements fail,Large differences gain importance,Athlete misses supplement benefit,,,,option4,Correct! Missing a true supplement benefit is an example of a harmful Type II error.,Incorrect. Not detecting a true effect is a harmful Type II error.,mcq
A researcher investigates a new stretching routine’s effect on flexibility. The researcher fails to reject the null even though the routine does improve flexibility. What type of error did the researcher make?,4,Type 1,Type 2,Random error,No error,,,,option2,Correct! Failing to detect a true effect is a Type II error.,Incorrect. A Type II error occurs here due to not rejecting a false null hypothesis.,mcq
"A professor concludes a new dietary supplement increases endurance, but later it is shown it had no effect. This is an example of",4,Type 1,Type 2,Random error,A combination of Type 1 and 2,,,,option1,Correct! Incorrectly rejecting a true null hypothesis is a Type I error.,"Incorrect. This is a Type I error, as the effect was falsely concluded.",mcq
"An athletic trainer concludes a new agility drill does not improve soccer players’ reaction time, but it actually does. What type of error was likely made?",4,The drill improves when it does not,The drill does not improve,The drill worsens,The drill results are accurate,,,,option2,Correct! A Type II error means failing to detect a true effect.,Incorrect. A Type II error implies missing an existing effect.,mcq
The likelihood of a Type I error is determined by the,4,Hypothesis test decision,P value,Sample size,Alpha level,,,,option4,Correct! The Type I error likelihood is set by alpha.,Incorrect. Alpha level sets the probability of a Type I error.,mcq
"In a study on injury prevention in Formula One, the null states the new tech does not reduce risk. If researchers fail to reject this but it actually does reduce risk, what error occurred?",4,Type 1,Type 2,Random error,Standard error,,,,option2,Correct! A Type II error occurs when a real effect is missed.,Incorrect. Failing to reject a false null hypothesis is a Type II error.,mcq
"A study concludes that a balance program improves stability in older adults, but it does not. What error has occurred?",4,Type 1,Type 2,Random error,Standard error,,,,option1,Correct! Incorrectly rejecting a true null hypothesis is a Type I error.,Incorrect. A Type I error occurs when a false positive is concluded.,mcq
"A team concludes a rehabilitation method does not reduce recovery time for sprains, but later it is proven to do so. What kind of error occurred?",4,Type 1,Type 2,Random error,Standard error,,,,option2,Correct! Failing to detect a real effect is a Type II error.,"Incorrect. This is a Type II error, missing a true effect.",mcq
"If α is set to .05, what is the value of β?",4,0.01,Unknown,0.8,0.2,,,,option2,Correct! The value of β cannot be determined from α alone.,"Incorrect. Without additional data, β remains unknown.",mcq
A researcher employs α = .01 instead of .05. How does this affect Type II error?,4,Cannot be determined,Type II error increases,Type II error unchanged,Type II error decreases,,,,option2,Correct! Lowering alpha typically raises Type II error likelihood.,Incorrect. Lowering α often leads to increased Type II error.,mcq
"If a researcher wants to decrease the Type II error rate, what must increase?",4,Power,False positive rate,Effect size,Sample size,,,,option1,Correct! Increasing power reduces the Type II error likelihood.,Incorrect. Increasing power is key to lowering Type II error.,mcq
