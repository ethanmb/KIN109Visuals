"A researcher conducts a study to increase the activity level (e.g., minutes of aerobic activity per day) of children between the ages of 6 and 17. The researcher finds a 95% confidence interval of the mean of 59.5 to 61.4. Which of the following is correct?",4,There is a 95% chance that the true mean lies in the 59.5 – 61.4 range.,"If the null hypothesis was μ = 60, then it can be rejected.",There was a 95% chance that the procedure would yield a confidence interval containing the population mean minutes of activity for the group sampled.,"If we take another sample from the same population, then there is only a 5% chance the new sample will not contain the sample mean.",,,,option2,"Correct! Since the null hypothesis value of μ = 60 falls within the 95% confidence interval of the sample, we can reject the null hypothesis.","Incorrect. The null hypothesis can be rejected based on this confidence interval, as it suggests there is a significant difference between the sample mean and the hypothesized population mean.",mcq
"An academic advisor was interested in whether students who followed a pre-med track scored higher than the national average on the MCAT exam in 2019, which was 500.9 (Association of American Medical Colleges, 2019). Based on a sample of 1000 students with a sample mean of 503.5, the 95% confidence interval was 502.84 to 504.16. Based on this confidence interval, which of the following is the appropriate two-tailed hypothesis test decision (α = .05)?",4,"Reject the null hypothesis, because the population mean is not included in the confidence interval.","Fail to reject the null hypothesis, because the sample mean is included in the confidence interval.","Reject the null hypothesis, because the sample mean is included in the confidence interval.","Fail to reject the null hypothesis, because the population mean is not included in the confidence interval.",,,,option1,Correct! The null hypothesis should be rejected because the population mean is outside the confidence interval.,Incorrect. The correct decision is to reject the null hypothesis because the population mean is not within the confidence interval.,
"Researchers sampled a group of participants who completed a sleep intervention study and identified the 95% confidence interval of the mean hours of sleep as [8.15, 8.35]. For this example, the probability that a confidence interval will contain the true population mean is 95%, which is also known as",4,the confidence level.,alpha (α).,the Type I error rate.,Power,,,,option1,Correct! The confidence level is the probability that the confidence interval contains the true population mean.,"Incorrect. Alpha (α) and Type I error refer to the probability of rejecting a true null hypothesis, which is not what a confidence interval is about.",mcq
An instructor implemented a training intervention targeted at improving students’ VO2max compared to the VO2max average for those students’ age. A sample of 55 students had a 95% confidence interval of 37.5 to 39.4. The midpoint of the confidence interval for the mean is the,4,sample mean.,population mean minus the sample mean.,population mean.,squared deviation score.,,,,option1,"Correct! The midpoint of the confidence interval gives the sample mean, which is the best point estimate of the population mean.","Incorrect. The population mean is estimated using the sample mean, but the midpoint of the confidence interval directly refers to the sample mean.",mcq
A researcher conducts a replication study but modifies the methods. The results reveal that the replication study has a larger effect size than the initial study. What effect will this change in effect size have on the distributions?,4,The means for the population and sample will be farther apart.,The analysis will have less power.,The Type I error probability will have decreased.,The sampling distribution will have a smaller spread.,,,,option1,"Correct! A larger effect size indicates that the sample mean has shifted farther from the population mean, leading to a larger gap between the two.","Incorrect. Increasing the effect size increases the difference between population and sample means, and does not necessarily affect power or Type I error directly.",mcq
"A researcher conducted a study on the effects of a dietary program on weight loss. The sample mean weight loss is 7.3 kg, and the 95% confidence interval is [6.1 kg, 8.5 kg]. What does this confidence interval suggest?",4,The true population mean weight loss is exactly 7.3 kg.,The true population mean weight loss is likely between 6.1 kg and 8.5 kg.,The population mean weight loss cannot be greater than 8.5 kg.,The sample mean weight loss will always fall within this interval in future studies.,,,,option2,Correct! The 95% confidence interval means we are 95% confident that the true population mean falls between 6.1 kg and 8.5 kg.,"Incorrect. The sample mean only serves as an estimate, and the interval suggests where the true population mean likely falls.",mcq
"If the null hypothesis states that the population mean weight loss is 5 kg, what can the researchers conclude?",4,Fail to reject the null hypothesis because 5kg is not in the confidence interval.,Reject the null hypothesis because 5kg is not in the confidence interval.,Fail to reject the null hypothesis because the confidence interval is too wide.,Reject the null hypothesis because the sample mean is lower than the 5kg.,,,,option2,"Correct! Since 5 kg does not fall within the 95% confidence interval, we can reject the null hypothesis.","Incorrect. The interval clearly suggests that the population mean is unlikely to be 5 kg, so the null hypothesis should be rejected.",mcq
"Researchers calculate a 95% confidence interval for sprint performance in a small sample (n=10) that ranges from 1.5 to 2.8 seconds. If the researchers increase the sample size to 100, what is likely to happen to the width of the confidence interval?",4,The width will decrease.,The width will increase.,The width will stay the same.,The width will shrink to a single value.,,,,option1,"Correct! As sample size increases, the standard error decreases, which leads to a narrower confidence interval.","Incorrect. Increasing the sample size decreases the margin of error, which narrows the confidence interval.",mcq
How does increasing the confidence level from 90% to 99% affect the width of the confidence interval?,4,The width will decrease.,The width will stay the same.,The width will increase.,The width will shrink to a single value.,,,,option3,"Correct! A higher confidence level means a broader range of possible values that the interval covers, leading to a wider confidence interval.","Incorrect. Increasing the confidence level increases the coverage of possible values, so the confidence interval will widen.",mcq
