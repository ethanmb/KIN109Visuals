Why is it necessary to report effect size along with the results of an independent-samples t-test?,4,To confirm the result of the hypothesis test.,To provide a measure of whether the study should be published.,To decide if the null hypothesis should be rejected.,To help a reader determine the importance of the difference.,,,,option4,Correct! Effect size provides additional context on the practical significance of the result.,"Incorrect. Effect size aids in understanding the magnitude, not the hypothesis test outcome.",mcq
"An anatomy professor wishes to examine whether movement breaks in class benefit test performance. Prior results show an average exam score of 0.61 with a standard deviation of 0.15 with no movement breaks. After breaks, the sample mean is 0.67, d = 0.40.",4,Fail to reject the null hypothesis; the difference is not statistically significant.,The sample mean is 0.40 standard deviations below the population mean.,There is a significant difference between the means.,The sample mean is 0.40 standard deviations above the population mean.,,,,option4,Correct! An effect size of 0.40 means the sample mean is above the population mean by 0.40 SD.,"Incorrect. The sample mean is actually above, not below, by 0.40 standard deviations.",mcq
"After running a hypothesis test comparing the mean number of power gels per package to the manufacturer’s claim, effect size is d = -1.2. Considering this effect size, the p value associated with the test statistic",4,"must be < .05, because there is a large effect.","must be > .05, because there is a large effect.",cannot be determined.,is likely close to .01.,,,,option4,"Correct! A large effect size, such as d = -1.2, typically corresponds to a p-value close to 0.01.",Incorrect. The effect size here is large enough to suggest a p-value closer to 0.01 than 0.05.,mcq
Why is effect size related to importance?,4,Effect size is another way to confirm the findings of hypothesis testing,Effect size includes sample size so it is reliable.,Effect size indicates if the results of sampling are likely due to chance.,Effect size provides a measure of the size of the difference that is not influenced by sample size.,,,,option4,"Correct! Effect size offers insight into the magnitude of the difference, independent of sample size.","Incorrect. Effect size is not directly influenced by sample size, it reflects magnitude.",mcq
"The separation between the null and alternative distributions is affected by ______, whereas the spread of these distributions is affected by ______.",4,alpha level; sample size,sample size; effect size,effect size; sample size,alpha level; effect size,,,,option3,"Correct! The separation relates to effect size, while spread is affected by sample size.",Incorrect. Effect size impacts the separation; sample size impacts spread.,mcq
Which of the following best describes why a statistically significant result may not always be practically meaningful?,4,p-values depend heavily on effect size.,"Statistical significance is influenced by sample size, while practical significance reflects real-world impact.",Statistical significance always indicates a large effect.,Practical significance only matters when the p-value is exactly 0.05.,,,,option2,"Correct! Statistical significance can be achieved with large sample sizes, even if practical significance is low.",Incorrect. Statistical significance does not necessarily indicate practical importance.,mcq
"In a study on the effect of a new endurance training program, Cohen’s d is calculated to be 0.8. What does this indicate about the effect size?",4,Small effect size,Medium effect size,Large effect size,No effect,,,,option3,Correct! An effect size of 0.8 is considered large according to Cohen’s guidelines.,"Incorrect. According to Cohen’s guidelines, an effect size of 0.8 is considered large.",mcq
"In a study on the effect of a new training regimen for reaction time, Cohen’s d is calculated to be 0.2. What does this indicate about the effect size?",4,Small effect size,Medium effect size,Large effect size,No effect,,,,option1,Correct! An effect size of 0.2 is considered small according to Cohen’s guidelines.,Incorrect. An effect size of 0.2 is generally seen as small.,mcq
A researcher investigating the effects of an 8-week resistance training program on resting heart rate found a statistically significant result but with a small effect size (Cohen’s d = 0.2). What is an appropriate conclusion?,4,The resistance program had a large practical effect on resting heart rate.,The result is statistically significant but may not be practically meaningful.,The resistance program should be considered ineffective.,The effect size indicates that the result is statistically significant.,,,,option2,Correct! The small effect size suggests the result’s practical significance may be limited.,Incorrect. Statistical significance alone does not imply practical importance.,mcq
Which of the following best describes Cohen’s d?,4,It measures how large the sample is in a study.,It measures the strength of the relationship between two variables in terms of correlation.,It measures the difference between two group means in terms of standard deviation units.,It is used to calculate the p-value in hypothesis testing.,,,,option3,Correct! Cohen’s d quantifies the difference between means in standard deviation units.,"Incorrect. Cohen’s d is used to measure effect size, not sample size or correlation strength.",mcq
A researcher reports an R² value of 0.25 in a regression analysis predicting physical activity levels based on age. What does this R² value indicate?,4,Age explains 25% of the variability in physical activity levels.,"Age is responsible for a small, but statistically significant effect.",Physical activity is not influenced by age.,Age predicts 100% of physical activity levels.,,,,option1,Correct! An R² of 0.25 means age accounts for 25% of the variability in physical activity levels.,"Incorrect. R² represents the percentage of variability explained, not necessarily significance or total prediction.",mcq
Which of the following would be considered a medium effect size according to Cohen’s d guidelines?,4,0.1,0.8,0.2,0.5,,,,option4,Correct! A value of 0.5 is considered a medium effect size according to Cohen’s guidelines.,"Incorrect. A value of 0.5 is considered medium, not small or large.",mcq
A study with a small sample size finds a non-significant result and a medium effect size; which of the following is true?,4,The study likely made a Type 1 error.,The study is underpowered and may have made a Type 2 error.,The effect size suggests that the result is practically irrelevant.,The result should be ignored due to the non-significant result.,,,,option2,"Correct! A small sample size with a medium effect suggests the study may be underpowered, risking a Type 2 error.",Incorrect. Small sample size can lead to Type 2 errors when effect size is medium but sample lacks power.,mcq
A researcher is measuring activity levels in adults after a health seminar. She wants to compare this to the recommended US average activity level. What would provide this information?,4,One-sample t-test,Standard error of the mean,Effect size,Confidence interval,,,,option3,Correct! Effect size helps gauge the size of difference between the sample and recommended averages.,"Incorrect. Effect size quantifies the magnitude of difference, which helps in such comparisons.",mcq
"Assume that the average time for an adult to run 1 mile is x9.24 minutes, with a standard deviation of x0.67. A researcher measured the time for adults who were physically active, but did not previously run, to complete a 1 mile run and compared it to population values. Calculate Cohen's xd as a measure of effect size. Give your answer to two decimal places.",0,,,,,,,,-2.06,"Correct! Cohen's d calculated here is -2.06, indicating a large effect size.",Incorrect. Be sure to apply the formula for Cohen's d accurately.,fitb
