Which term describes the number of observations for each value of a variable?,4,Rolling average,Percent,Differential,Distribution,,,,option4,Correct! Distributions show how frequently a value of a variable occurs and can be represented with histograms and frequency charts.,Incorrect. The correct term is Distribution.,mcq
In what way does a histogram differ from a bar graph?,4,Frequency is represented by bar height in a bar graph,The y-axis on a histogram typically starts with 0,A histogram can be used with ratio-level variables on the x-axis,A histogram displays frequency on the y-axis,,,,option3,"Correct! Histograms are used for ratio-level variables, which are continuous. Bars touch, and the data is grouped in intervals. Both histograms and bar graphs use bar height for frequency, and their y-axes can start at 0.","Incorrect. Histograms are distinct in their use for continuous ratio-level data, where the bars touch to indicate intervals. Both can start y-axes at 0.",mcq
Which variable would be appropriate for a frequency distribution displayed in a histogram?,4,"Preferred type of exercise (cardio, strength training, yoga)","Ranking in a 100-meter sprint (first, second, third, etc.)",Time spent exercising in minutes,None of the above,,,,option3,"Correct! Time spent exercising in minutes is continuous data, making it appropriate for a histogram. Time intervals can be grouped and frequency displayed.","Incorrect. Histograms are used to display continuous data, and time is a ratio-level variable appropriate for a histogram.",mcq
The order of the bars in a bar graph for a nominal-level variable is,4,From highest to lowest,Determined by frequency of occurrence,From lowest to highest,Arbitrary,,,,option4,"Correct! Nominal-level variables (e.g., colors, sports, seasons) do not have an inherent order, so the bars can be placed in any order.","Incorrect. Nominal variables do not have a specific order, so the arrangement of bars is arbitrary.",mcq
Which variable can be used on the x-axis of a frequency polygon?,4,Heart rate during a VO2 max test,Preferred type of exercise,Most commonly used exercise machine at a gym,Favorite sport,,,,option1,"Correct! Heart rate during a VO2 max test is continuous data, suitable for a frequency polygon where data points are connected by lines. Options B, C, and D are categorical and more suitable for bar graphs.","Incorrect. Heart rate is continuous data, making it appropriate for a frequency polygon, unlike categorical variables.",mcq
For which of the following would a histogram be most suitable?,4,Athleteâ€™s performance rank at a competition,Favourite sport,Primary muscle group targeted during a workout,Hours of exercise completed last week,,,,option4,Correct! Hours of exercise completed last week is continuous data that can be grouped into intervals and displayed on a histogram to show frequency. Other options are categorical or ordinal and better suited for bar graphs.,"Incorrect. Histograms are most suitable for continuous data, like hours of exercise, while categorical data is better suited for bar graphs.",mcq
Which series of values could have come from the x-axis of a histogram?,4,10; 20; 30; 40; 50; 60; 70; 80; 90; 100,red; orange; yellow; green; blue; indigo; violet,Athletic therapist; physiotherapist; occupational therapist; nutritionist; massage therapist; sports physician; sports psychologist; kinesiologist,15; 40; 50; 65; 85; 95; 110; 120; 125; 140,,,,option1,"Correct! These values are continuous and can be grouped into intervals, suitable for a histogram's x-axis. The other options represent categorical or unevenly spaced data, better suited to a bar graph.","Incorrect. Only continuous data, like the series in option A, is appropriate for the x-axis of a histogram.",mcq
"As a whole, a histogram depicts the _____ of the variable of interest.",4,Frequency of occurrence,The nominal to ordinal ratio,Distribution,The nominal to ordinal interval,,,,option3,Correct! Histograms visually represent the frequency distribution of a variable within a data set.,"Incorrect. Histograms depict the distribution of data, not just frequency or nominal ratios.",mcq
Typically the x-axis of a bar graph shows:,4,Frequency,The distribution,The values of the variable of interest,Percent,,,,option3,"Correct! The x-axis of a bar graph shows the categorical or numerical values being measured or compared, while frequency and percent are suited to the y-axis.","Incorrect. The x-axis of a bar graph shows the values being measured, not frequency or distribution, which are more associated with the y-axis or graph shape.",mcq
