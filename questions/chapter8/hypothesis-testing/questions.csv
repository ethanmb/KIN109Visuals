Which of the following would be appropriate for a one-way between-groups ANOVA?,4,Researchers want to examine the relationship VO‚ÇÇ max and marathon performance time.,"Researchers compared the mean perceived exertion during cycling at 60% HR max among groups of participants who consumed high-carb, high-fat, or no meal before the exercise.",Researchers want to test for a difference in balance scores before and after a new training program.,Coaches are interested in whether stretching duration predicts sprint performance.,,,,option2,Correct! This example includes 1 independent variable (meal type) with 3 groups and a continuous dependent variable (mean perceived exertion).,"Incorrect. The other options either involve correlations, predictive analyses, or within-subjects designs not suitable for a one-way ANOVA.",mcq
A researcher conducted a one-way between-groups ANOVA to compare 3 training regimens on 1RM performance. What can be concluded based on ùúÇ¬≤ = 0.15?,4,The conditions of training can explain 15% of the variance in 1RM performance.,The groups differed by 0.15 standard deviations on average.,There was not a significant difference in mean 1RM scores among the groups.,The difference in mean 1RM scores among the groups was significantly different.,,,,option1,Correct! The effect size (Œ∑2) indicates the proportion of variance in 1RM performance explained by training regimen.,Incorrect. This measure doesn‚Äôt represent standard deviations or directly imply statistical significance.,mcq
Select an appropriate null hypothesis for a one-way between-groups ANOVA.,4,"There is a difference in VO‚ÇÇ max levels between athletes in endurance sports, power sports, and team sports.",There is a difference in VO‚ÇÇ max levels between athletes in endurance and power sports.,"There is no difference in VO‚ÇÇ max levels between athletes in endurance sports, power sports, and team sports.",Athletes in endurance sports have significantly higher VO‚ÇÇ max levels than athletes in power sports but do not differ significantly from team sport athletes.,,,,option3,Correct! The null hypothesis for ANOVA assumes no difference across the group means.,Incorrect. The null hypothesis does not predict differences or directional outcomes.,mcq
A researcher was comparing post-exercise recovery satisfaction among participants assigned to three recovery methods. What can be concluded based on ùúÇ¬≤ = 0.27?,4,The recovery methods can explain 27% of the variance in post-exercise recovery satisfaction.,The difference in mean post-exercise recovery satisfaction scores among the groups was significantly different.,The groups differed by 0.27 standard deviations on average.,The difference in mean post-exercise recovery satisfaction scores among the groups was not significantly different.,,,,option1,Correct! The effect size (Œ∑2) indicates the proportion of variance explained by recovery methods.,"Incorrect. Œ∑2reflects explained variance, not standard deviations or direct significance.",mcq
A researcher conducted a one-way ANOVA to test hydration effects on sprint performance times. ùúÇ¬≤ = 0.08. What is the appropriate interpretation?,4,There was not a statistically significant difference in mean sprint performance times among participants in the 4 hydration conditions.,There was a small difference in mean sprint performance times among participants in the 4 hydration conditions.,0.08% of the variance in sprint performance times can be explained by hydration conditions.,8% of the variance in sprint performance times can be explained by hydration conditions.,,,,option4,Correct! The effect size shows that 8% of the variance in sprint times is explained by hydration conditions.,"Incorrect. 0.08 represents 8%, not 0.08%, and statistical significance depends on the F-test, not Œ∑2.",mcq
Effect size measures for ANOVA (Œ∑2) provide estimates of:,4,The size of the mean difference between the groups.,The proportion of variance in the dependent variable explained by the independent variable.,The proportion of variance in the independent variable due to the dependent variable.,The level of significance for the null hypothesis test.,,,,option2,Correct! Œ∑2quantifies the proportion of variance in the dependent variable attributable to the independent variable.,"Incorrect. Effect size does not measure mean differences, variance in the independent variable, or significance levels.",mcq
Which of the following best represents the null hypothesis in an ANOVA test with three groups?,4,At least one group mean is different from the others.,All group means are equal to zero.,The variance within groups is greater than the variance between groups.,"The group means are equal to each other, regardless of their values.",,,,option4,"Correct! The null hypothesis assumes that all group means are equal, without specifying their actual values.",Incorrect. The null hypothesis does not predict variances or assume means are zero.,mcq
"In an ANOVA analysis, what does the alternative hypothesis state?",4,All group means are different from one another.,The variance within groups is less than the variance between groups.,At least one group mean is different.,There is a significant difference in the variance of the outcome variable.,,,,option3,Correct! The alternative hypothesis indicates that at least one group mean differs but does not specify which one.,Incorrect. The alternative hypothesis doesn‚Äôt assume all groups differ or compare variances directly.,mcq
"In a kinesiology study comparing muscle strength among athletes in four sports, the degrees of freedom for Between Groups Sum of Squares are:",4,"N-1, where N is the total sample size","k-1, where k is the number of groups","nj-1, where nj is the sample size for each group",The same as the degrees of freedom for Within Groups,,,,option2,"Correct! dfbetween‚Äã=k‚àí1, where krepresents the number of groups being compared.","Incorrect. The degrees of freedom depend on the number of groups, not individual samples or totals.",mcq
What does it mean if you reject the null hypothesis in an ANOVA test?,4,All group means are significantly different from each other.,At least one group is significantly different from another.,The variance within groups exceeds the variance between groups.,The total variability cannot be explained by group membership.,,,,option2,Correct! Rejecting the null hypothesis indicates at least one group mean is significantly different from the others.,Incorrect. Rejection does not guarantee all groups differ or focus solely on variances.,mcq
