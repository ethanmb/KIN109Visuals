What is the grouping variable in ANOVA?,4,A variable that explains differences in the outcome variable,A variable that measures the grand mean,A continuous variable on an interval or ratio scale,A measure of unsystematic variance,,,,option1,Correct! The grouping variable is the independent variable explaining differences in the outcome variable.,"Incorrect. The grouping variable is not a measure of the grand mean, continuous data, or unsystematic variance.",mcq
"In ANOVA, how is the variability between groups quantified?",4,By summing the squared deviations of individual scores from their group means,By comparing group means to the grand mean and weighting by group size,By calculating the variance of the outcome variable across all participants,By dividing the total variance by the number of groups,,,,option2,"Correct! Between-groups variability measures deviations of group means from the grand mean, weighted by group size.",Incorrect. This does not involve individual scores or dividing total variance by group count.,mcq
What is the minimum number of groups (k) required to perform an ANOVA?,4,1,2,3,4,,,,option2,Correct! ANOVA requires at least 2 groups to compare means.,Incorrect. ANOVA is not performed with fewer than 2 groups.,mcq
Which of the following best describes the Total Sum of Squares in ANOVA?,4,"The total variability in the dataset, regardless of group membership",The average variance within each group,The variance between group means only,The pooled variance estimate across all groups,,,,option1,Correct! The Total Sum of Squares measures the overall variability in the dataset without considering groups.,Incorrect. It doesn’t focus solely on within-group or between-group variability.,mcq
What is the primary focus of the “Within Groups Sum of Squares” in ANOVA?,4,Explaining variability between group means,Quantifying variability within each group as random error,Measuring the total variability in the dataset,Calculating the average score for each group,,,,option2,Correct! The Within Groups Sum of Squares represents random error within groups.,"Incorrect. This focuses on within-group variability, not total or average scores.",mcq
