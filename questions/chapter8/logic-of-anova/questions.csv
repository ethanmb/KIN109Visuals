What distinguishes a one-way ANOVA from a two-way ANOVA?,4,The number of levels in the independent variable,The number of dependent variables analyzed,The number of factors being studied,The inclusion of random error as a variable,,,,option3,Correct! A one-way ANOVA involves one factor (independent variable) with two or more levels.,Incorrect. A two-way ANOVA involves two factors being studied.,mcq
Which of the following is a source of unsystematic variance in an ANOVA?,4,Treatment effects,Measurement error,Systematic differences between groups,Explanatory variance,,,,option2,"Correct! Unsystematic variance includes random error sources, such as individual differences.","Incorrect. Measurement error is unsystematic, not systematic.",mcq
What type of variability is reflected in differences between an individual’s score and their group’s mean?,4,Between-groups variance,Total variance,Within-groups variance,Treatment effects,,,,option3,Correct! Within-groups variance reflects individual differences from their group’s mean.,"Incorrect. This variance reflects within-group differences, not between-group differences.",mcq
What is the F-ratio in the context of ANOVA?,4,A measure of the average scores within a group,A test statistic used to compare the variance between groups to the variance within groups,A measure of individual differences across all participants,A statistic that measures the total variance in the dataset,,,,option2,Correct! The F-ratio compares between-group variance to within-group variance.,Incorrect. The F-ratio is not a simple average or measure of total variance.,mcq
"In an ANOVA comparing athletes at 3 competitive levels (provincial, national, international), what does the grand mean represent?",4,The mean score of the provincial-level athletes,"The overall mean score across all athletes, regardless of group",The difference between the highest and lowest group means,The standard deviation of the national-level group,,,,option2,Correct! The grand mean represents the average across all groups and observations.,Incorrect. The grand mean is not specific to any one group or difference.,mcq
What does a statistically significant F-ratio indicate in the context of ANOVA?,4,All individual scores within groups are equal,At least one group mean differs significantly from others,The total variability in the dataset is zero,The null hypothesis cannot be rejected,,,,option2,Correct! A significant F-ratio suggests systematic differences between group means.,Incorrect. It does not mean all scores are equal or that the null hypothesis must hold true.,mcq
