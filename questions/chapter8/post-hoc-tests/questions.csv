Why is a t-test not suitable for comparing the means of three or more groups?,4,It is computationally impossible.,It increases the Type 1 error rate.,It is not capable of handling population means.,It cannot analyze differences in variances.,,,,option2,"Correct! Running multiple t-tests inflates the Type 1 error rate, which ANOVA avoids by comparing all groups simultaneously.","Incorrect. The limitation lies in error inflation, not computational or analytical capability.",mcq
Which of the following scenarios is appropriate for a one-way ANOVA?,4,Comparing the VO₂ max of athletes before and after training.,Comparing the VO₂ max of athletes across 3 different exercise regimens.,Comparing the average speed of athletes over 3 consecutive trials.,Comparing the VO₂ max of paired twins under the same exercise regimen.,,,,option2,Correct! A one-way ANOVA is appropriate for comparing the means of a continuous variable across three or more independent groups.,Incorrect. The other scenarios involve repeated measures or paired designs unsuitable for one-way ANOVA.,mcq
What is the primary purpose of post hoc testing in an ANOVA?,4,To test the normality of the data.,To identify which specific group means are significantly different.,To evaluate the homogeneity of variances.,To calculate the F-statistic.,,,,option2,Correct! Post hoc tests determine which specific group comparisons are statistically significant.,"Incorrect. Post hoc testing focuses on group comparisons, not assumptions or test statistics.",mcq
When is a Bonferroni test most appropriate?,4,When wanting a less conservative approach to multiple comparisons.,When there are unequal variances between groups.,When one needs to control Type 1 error across multiple comparisons.,When one is only interested in comparing two groups.,,,,option3,Correct! The Bonferroni correction is used to control family-wise Type 1 error across multiple comparisons.,Incorrect. Bonferroni is conservative and not limited to pairwise comparisons or unequal variances.,mcq
Tukey’s Honestly Significant Difference (HSD) test is preferred over the Bonferroni correction when:,4,You have unequal group sizes.,You want to retain higher statistical power.,You are comparing only two groups.,You want to avoid using software for calculations.,,,,option2,Correct! Tukey’s HSD test maintains higher power and is suitable for pairwise comparisons of equal interest.,"Incorrect. Tukey’s HSD is not specific to unequal sizes, two groups, or manual calculations.",mcq
Which assumption is not required for a one-way ANOVA?,4,Dependent variable is measured on an interval or ratio scale.,Independent observations.,Equal sample sizes in each group.,Homogeneity of variances.,,,,option3,"Correct! Equal sample sizes are not required for ANOVA, though other assumptions must be met.","Incorrect. ANOVA requires a continuous dependent variable, independence, and homogeneity of variances.",mcq
Which diagnostic tool is commonly used to assess the normality of residuals in ANOVA?,4,Histogram,Boxplot,Q-Q plot,Scatterplot,,,,option3,Correct! A Q-Q plot visually assesses whether residuals follow a normal distribution.,Incorrect. Other tools may visualize data but are not designed for testing normality of residuals.,mcq
What is the key difference between repeated measures and one-way ANOVA?,4,The use of non-continuous data.,Comparing means across different time points for the same participants.,Comparing means across different groups.,The ability to handle more than two independent variables.,,,,option2,Correct! Repeated measures ANOVA focuses on changes over time or conditions for the same participants.,Incorrect. Repeated measures requires continuous data and focuses on within-participant differences.,mcq
