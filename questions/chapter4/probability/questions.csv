The probability of an event equals _____ divided by the number of possible outcomes.,4,The number of outcomes in an event set,The number of possible events,The number of independent outcomes,The number of dependent outcomes,,,,option1,Correct! The probability of an event is calculated by dividing the number of outcomes in an event set by the total possible outcomes.,Incorrect. The correct answer is the number of outcomes in an event set.,mcq
A discrete probability distribution,5,Represents the probability of each value of a variable.,"Both gives the probability of ranges of values under a mathematical function and describes only contrived events, such as dice rolling.","Both represent the probability of each value of a variable and has only two values, p and 1－p.","Describes only contrived events, such as dice rolling.","Has only two values, p and 1－p",,,option1,"Correct! A discrete probability distribution gives the probability of each possible value of a discrete variable, like rolling a die.","Incorrect. Discrete probability distributions can represent each value, but they are not limited to just two values.",mcq
Probability is an important consideration in statistics:,4,Because of randomness introduced by sampling.,As a way of generating sample data sets.,As a way of summarizing a set of data.,Because observations are typically not independent.,,,,option1,"Correct! Probability helps quantify randomness and uncertainty introduced by sampling, allowing for better inferences about the population.",Incorrect. Probability is more relevant to quantifying randomness rather than summarizing or generating data sets.,mcq
