One characteristic of a normal distribution is:,3,Skewness,Symmetry,Asymmetry,,,,,option2,"Correct! In a normal distribution, the left and right sides are mirror images, creating symmetry around the mean.","Incorrect. The correct characteristic is symmetry, not skewness or asymmetry.",mcq
"In a normal distribution, approximately what percentage of observations will be beyond 2 standard deviations of the mean?",4,5%,95%,34%,16%,,,,option1,"Correct! According to the empirical rule (68-95-99), 95% of observations are within 2 standard deviations, so 5% are beyond.","Incorrect. The 95% figure refers to the percentage within 2 standard deviations, not beyond them.",mcq
"In a normal distribution, most of the observations are found",4,In or near the center of the distribution,Toward the edges of the distribution,Nearer the right (higher) end of the distribution,Nearer the left (lower) end of the distribution,,,,option1,"Correct! In a normal distribution, most observations cluster around the mean, with fewer as you move toward the edges.","Incorrect. Observations in a normal distribution are concentrated around the center, not toward the edges or one specific end.",mcq
