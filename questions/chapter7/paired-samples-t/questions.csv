"When comparing the effectiveness of a new rehabilitation program on knee mobility, which t-test would be most appropriate?",4,Independent-samples t-test,Paired-samples t-test,Single-sample t-test,Population parameter test,,,,option2,Correct! This repeated-measures design requires a paired-samples t-test for pre- and post-intervention effects.,Incorrect. A paired-samples t-test is appropriate because it tests the same participants before and after the intervention.,mcq
"A researcher calculates the mean difference in grip strength after a program (MD = 4 kg, SD = 3 kg) for 25 participants. What is the estimated standard error of MD?",4,0.75 kg,0.60 kg,1.20 kg,1.80 kg,,,,option2,"Correct! Using the formula for standard error with SD = 3 kg and sample size = 25, the standard error is 0.60 kg.",Incorrect. The standard error is calculated using the formula with SD = 3 kg and sample size = 25.,mcq
"In a reaction time study, a researcher uses a two-tailed paired-samples t-test with alpha = 0.05, a t-statistic of 3.2, and a critical value of 2.064. What is correct?",4,Reject the null hypothesis,Fail to reject the null,Reject the alternative,Fail to reject the alternative,,,,option1,"Correct! Since the t-statistic exceeds the critical value, the null hypothesis is rejected.",Incorrect. The null hypothesis should be rejected as the t-statistic exceeds the critical value.,mcq
The effect size for a strength training program was calculated as d = 2.24. What does this value indicate?,4,The program had a small effect,The program had a moderate effect,The program had a large effect,The program has no effect,,,,option3,"Correct! A Cohen's d of 0.8 or larger suggests a large effect, indicating a strong impact of the program.","Incorrect. According to Cohenâ€™s d, a value of 0.8 or larger suggests a large effect.",mcq
A kinesiologist finds that the average difference score in Formula One driver reaction times is negative after caffeine intake. What does this mean?,3,Reaction times improved,Reaction times decreased,Caffeine had no effect,,,,,option1,Correct! A negative difference indicates faster (improved) reaction times post-caffeine.,Incorrect. A negative difference score means reaction times improved (became faster).,mcq
"A study investigated physical therapy's effect on knee pain levels, finding a 95% CI for mean difference in pain as -5 to -2. What does this interval suggest?",4,Physical therapy had no effect,The effect was small and non-significant,Physical therapy significantly reduced pain,Physical therapy increased pain,,,,option3,Correct! A CI not including 0 suggests a statistically significant effect; a negative interval indicates pain reduction.,Incorrect. The interval suggests a significant reduction in knee pain because it does not include 0.,mcq
