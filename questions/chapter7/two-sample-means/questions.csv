Which of the following scenarios best illustrates when to use a paired-samples t-test?,4,Comparing flexibility between individuals who stretch regularly and those who do not.,Comparing the effects of two different types of physical therapy on two separate groups.,Comparing cognitive performance in individuals after they have taken two different supplements on separate occasions.,Comparing protein synthesis rates between biological males and females after protein supplementation.,,,,option3,Correct! Paired-samples t-test is used when measurements are taken from the same individuals under different conditions.,Incorrect. A paired-samples t-test involves the same individuals under two different conditions.,mcq
"In an independent-samples t-test, which of the following best describes the data structure?",4,Data is collected from the same individuals at two time points.,Data is collected from two independent groups of participants.,Data is paired between two related groups.,Data is collected from a single group across multiple conditions.,,,,option2,"Correct! An independent-samples t-test compares two distinct, independent groups with different participants in each group.",Incorrect. An independent-samples t-test is designed for distinct groups with no overlap.,mcq
Which of the following statements about the null hypothesis in t-tests is correct?,4,It assumes there is a significant difference between the sample means.,It assumes the sample means are different due to the intervention.,It assumes that the difference between the sample means is due to random chance.,It assumes one sample mean is significantly larger than the other.,,,,option3,"Correct! The null hypothesis assumes no true difference between means, any observed difference is likely random.","Incorrect. The null hypothesis assumes differences are due to random variation, not true effects.",mcq
What does a large standard error suggest in the context of t-tests?,4,Sample means should be close together.,Sampling error is minimal.,Bigger differences between the sample means are expected.,The sample means are likely from the same population.,,,,option3,"Correct! A large standard error indicates higher variability, making larger differences likely due to chance alone.","Incorrect. A large standard error means greater variability, suggesting observed differences could occur by chance alone.",mcq
"In the t-test formula, which component represents the “signal” in the signal-to-noise ratio?",4,The observed difference between the sample means,The expected difference if the null hypothesis is true,The standard error of the difference,The total sample size,,,,option1,Correct! The signal in a t-test is the observed difference between means.,Incorrect. The signal is the observed difference; noise is represented by the variability or standard error.,mcq
Which of the following best describes the main benefit of using a repeated-measures design for the paired-samples t-test?,4,It requires fewer participants to achieve statistical significance.,It allows for the direct comparison of two independent groups.,It minimizes variability due to individual differences.,It increases sampling error between conditions.,,,,option3,Correct! Repeated-measures design reduces variability by making each participant their own control.,"Incorrect. Repeated-measures designs control for individual differences, reducing variability that might obscure effects.",mcq
The independent-samples t-test requires two assumptions about the data. Which of the following is one of those assumptions?,4,The two groups have unequal variances.,The data is normally distributed in each group.,The same participants are measured under two conditions.,Data is measured on an ordinal scale.,,,,option2,Correct! Independent-samples t-test assumes normal distribution in each group and roughly equal variances.,Incorrect. Independent-samples t-test requires normal distribution in each group and equal variances between groups.,mcq
